# Implemented 
 * Actvitiy.
 * Venue \ room
 * start date
 * end date
 * event name

# Things I don't like 
* tool doesn't seem to allow lambda functions, or procedural style programming
* Why does regex pattern matching start at one?
  Really, 0 <- start its that simple '()'<-this should be %0 not %1 so annoying 
* you seem to just be pattern matching 
* it would might be faster to just get the user to type  in a specific format
* Functions don't work, so kinda makes the tool use less
